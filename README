Nishad94 / UoP-Result-Data-Analayzer

This is a python program that helps analyze various statistics from the UoP's result PDFs. It enables sorting based on overall score to find the combined ranks of 3 branches(Computer Engineering, IT, ENTC) as well as sorting based on individual branches, and even individual subjects. 

Currently it is made for 3 branches, but it can be easily extended.

Instructions to set it up:
1. By default the code contains PICT's combined result(in 'out_combined.txt') which I have already made from the 2 PDFs . I have commented out the code that enables this combining of files. So if you need to run this program on other college results you should un-comment it and change _FILE_ names accordingly.
2. Run the script by opening up the terminal and typing 'python CustomSort.py'
3. If you want to check your rank, pipe output to a txt file and then search your name in the file.
   eg:
   ' python CustomSort.py > output.txt
     1 	    // For overall rank
     2 12   // For entc rank	'
